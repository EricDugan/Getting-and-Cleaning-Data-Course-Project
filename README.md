# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository is for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains the code and codebook for the assignment.

The run_analysis.R script: 

    (1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    (2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    (3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    (4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    (5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md is the code book that describes the variables, the data, and steps performed to clean up the data
