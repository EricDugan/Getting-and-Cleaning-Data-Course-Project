## Code Book

Original CodeBook for the dataset used in this project can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

Libraries used: "tidyverse" and "curl"
    
Step #1 Merge data sets

        The training and test sets are mergred into one data set named "MergedData" 
        using the cbind and rbind functions

Step #2 Get only data for means and standard deviations for each measurment

        The measurements on the mean and standard deviatation for each measurement
        are extracted from "MergedData" and saved to the data set "MeasurementMeanSD" 
        using the select function.

Step #3 Assign descriptive names for activities

        "subjectID" is the ID number for each subject in the data set
        "activityID" is used to assign the descriptive name of each activity performed by the subjects.

Step #4 Renaming variables with more descriptive names

        All instances Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
        All instances of Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
        All instances of BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
        All instances of Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
        All instances of tBody in column's name replaced by TimeDomainBody
        All vars that start with character f in column’s name replaced by FrequencyDomain
        All vars that start with character t in column’s name replaced by TimeDomain 

Step #5 Create final tidy data set

        The average of each variable for each activity and subject is saved in a data set "SummaryData".
        This data set was created using the summarizing "MeasurementMeanData"
        Finally this data set is exported as "SummaryData.txt"
